Generic Radio - The udox "I need something to play and control mp3s and
someone will need to manage this cos I'm not doing it" django + flash app

This will be used for spinetv at first.

Installation
------------

Add 'radio' to your installed apps. In your root url conf add the following:

    (r'^radio$', include('radio.urls', namespace='radio')),

It is important you include the namespace as this is used in templates for
reversing urls. If you need to rename that then you'll need to update the
templates and any reverse calls.

Settings
--------

In your settings.py file you can set the following variables which will be
used in the templates for the banner and player titles:

    RADIO_SHOWLIST_LIMIT: The number of shows to load up in the latest list
    RADIO_SERIES_LIMIT: How many series items to show on the banner
    RADIO_RANDOM_SERIES: Whether to randomise the list of series on the banner
    RADIO_PLAYER_TITLE: The main title to use in the templates for this player
    RADIO_PLAYER_LEADIN: Used for the subtext under the radio banner heading
